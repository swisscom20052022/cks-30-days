# Chapter 21: Cluster Setup - Resource Quotas and Limits

## Introduction

In this chapter, we will explore the implementation and management of resource quotas and limits in a Kubernetes (K8s) cluster. Resource quotas and limits are essential for ensuring fair resource allocation, preventing resource contention, and maintaining the stability and performance of your applications. By the end of this chapter, you will understand how to create, apply, and manage resource quotas and limits to optimize resource usage in your Kubernetes environment.

## Main Concepts

In this chapter, we'll cover the following topics:
- Overview of resource quotas and limits
- Creating resource quotas
- Creating resource limits
- Applying resource quotas and limits
- Managing resource quotas and limits
- Best practices for resource quotas and limits

### Overview of Resource Quotas and Limits

Resource quotas and limits are mechanisms in Kubernetes that control the allocation and usage of resources, such as CPU and memory, within a namespace. They help ensure that resources are distributed fairly among applications and prevent any single application from consuming excessive resources.

- **Resource Quotas**: Define the total amount of resources that can be consumed by all pods and containers within a namespace.
- **Resource Limits**: Define the maximum amount of resources that a single pod or container can consume.

### Creating Resource Quotas

Resource quotas are defined using YAML manifests. Here is an example of a simple resource quota that limits the total CPU and memory usage within a namespace:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: compute-resources
  namespace: default
spec:
  hard:
    requests.cpu: "4"
    requests.memory: "8Gi"
    limits.cpu: "8"
    limits.memory: "16Gi"
```

This resource quota limits the total CPU requests to 4 cores, total memory requests to 8 GiB, total CPU limits to 8 cores, and total memory limits to 16 GiB within the `default` namespace.

### Creating Resource Limits

Resource limits are defined using YAML manifests and applied to individual pods or containers. Here is an example of a simple resource limit that restricts the CPU and memory usage of a container:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: resource-limits-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: resource-limits-container
    image: nginx
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: "500m"
        memory: "512Mi"
      limits:
        cpu: "1"
        memory: "1Gi"
```

This resource limit requests 500 millicores of CPU and 512 MiB of memory for the container, and sets the maximum CPU usage to 1 core and maximum memory usage to 1 GiB.

### Applying Resource Quotas and Limits

To apply resource quotas and limits, use the `kubectl apply` command:

```sh
kubectl apply -f resource-quota.yaml
kubectl apply -f resource-limits-pod.yaml
```

You can verify that the resource quotas and limits have been applied using the `kubectl get resourcequotas` and `kubectl describe pod` commands:

```sh
kubectl get resourcequotas -n default
kubectl describe pod resource-limits-pod
```

### Managing Resource Quotas and Limits

Managing resource quotas and limits involves monitoring resource usage, adjusting quotas and limits as needed, and ensuring that applications adhere to the defined policies. Here are some best practices for managing resource quotas and limits:

- Regularly monitor resource usage to identify potential issues and adjust quotas and limits accordingly.
- Use resource quotas to prevent resource contention and ensure fair resource allocation.
- Use resource limits to prevent individual applications from consuming excessive resources.
- Set appropriate requests and limits based on the resource requirements of your applications.
- Regularly review and update resource quotas and limits to ensure they meet your performance and stability requirements.

### Best Practices for Resource Quotas and Limits

- Define resource quotas and limits that align with your organization's resource allocation policies.
- Use resource quotas to control the total resource usage within a namespace.
- Use resource limits to control the resource usage of individual pods and containers.
- Regularly monitor and adjust resource quotas and limits to ensure optimal resource usage.
- Set appropriate requests and limits based on the resource requirements of your applications.
- Regularly review and update resource quotas and limits to ensure they meet your performance and stability requirements.

## CKS-Specific Tips and Tricks

- Familiarize yourself with the syntax and structure of resource quota and limit YAML manifests.
- Practice creating and applying resource quotas and limits in a test environment.
- Understand how to monitor and adjust resource quotas and limits.
- Memorize key commands and concepts that are frequently tested in the exam.

## Summary

In this chapter, we covered the implementation and management of resource quotas and limits in a Kubernetes cluster, including an overview of resource quotas and limits, creating and applying resource quotas and limits, managing resource quotas and limits, and best practices. By understanding how to use resource quotas and limits, you can optimize resource usage and maintain the stability and performance of your Kubernetes environment.
