# Chapter 22: Cluster Setup - Auditing and Logging

## Introduction

In this chapter, we will explore the implementation and management of auditing and logging in a Kubernetes (K8s) cluster. Auditing and logging are crucial for maintaining the security and compliance of your cluster, as well as for troubleshooting and monitoring activities. By the end of this chapter, you will understand how to implement and manage auditing and logging to secure your Kubernetes environment.

## Main Concepts

In this chapter, we'll cover the following topics:
- Overview of auditing and logging
- Setting up auditing
- Configuring audit policies
- Managing audit logs
- Best practices for auditing and logging

### Overview of Auditing and Logging

Auditing and logging in Kubernetes involve capturing and storing log data generated by the cluster and its components. Auditing focuses on recording security-relevant events, while logging captures general operational data. Both are essential for monitoring, troubleshooting, and ensuring compliance.

### Setting up Auditing

To set up auditing in a Kubernetes cluster, you need to configure the API server to capture audit events and store them in a log file. Here is an example of how to set up auditing:

1. Create an audit policy file to define which events to capture:

```yaml
apiVersion: audit.k8s.io/v1
kind: Policy
rules:
- level: Metadata
  resources:
  - group: ""
    resources: ["pods"]
- level: RequestResponse
  resources:
  - group: "rbac.authorization.k8s.io"
    resources: ["roles", "rolebindings"]
```

2. Update the API server configuration to use the audit policy file:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta2
kind: ClusterConfiguration
apiServer:
  extraArgs:
    audit-policy-file: /etc/kubernetes/audit-policy.yaml
    audit-log-path: /var/log/kubernetes/audit.log
    audit-log-maxage: "30"
    audit-log-maxbackup: "10"
    audit-log-maxsize: "100"
```

3. Restart the API server to apply the changes:

```sh
sudo systemctl restart kube-apiserver
```

### Configuring Audit Policies

Audit policies define which events to capture and at what level of detail. Here are some common audit levels:

- **None**: Do not log events.
- **Metadata**: Log only metadata about the request.
- **Request**: Log metadata and the request body.
- **RequestResponse**: Log metadata, the request body, and the response body.

Here is an example of an audit policy that captures different levels of events:

```yaml
apiVersion: audit.k8s.io/v1
kind: Policy
rules:
- level: Metadata
  resources:
  - group: ""
    resources: ["pods"]
- level: RequestResponse
  resources:
  - group: "rbac.authorization.k8s.io"
    resources: ["roles", "rolebindings"]
- level: None
  users: ["system:kube-proxy"]
```

### Managing Audit Logs

Managing audit logs involves collecting, storing, and analyzing audit data to gain insights into security-relevant events. Here are some best practices for managing audit logs:

- Use centralized logging solutions, such as Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana (EFK stack), to collect and store audit logs.
- Set up alerts to notify you of any suspicious or unauthorized activities.
- Regularly review audit logs to identify trends and potential security incidents.
- Implement retention policies to manage the storage and lifecycle of audit logs.

### Best Practices for Auditing and Logging

- Define clear audit policies to capture relevant events at the appropriate level of detail.
- Use centralized logging solutions to collect and store audit and log data.
- Set up alerts to notify you of any suspicious or unauthorized activities.
- Regularly review and analyze audit and log data to identify trends and potential security incidents.
- Implement retention policies to manage the storage and lifecycle of audit and log data.

## CKS-Specific Tips and Tricks

- Familiarize yourself with the syntax and structure of audit policy YAML files.
- Practice setting up and configuring auditing in a test environment.
- Understand how to use centralized logging solutions to collect and store audit logs.
- Memorize key commands and concepts that are frequently tested in the exam.

## Summary

In this chapter, we covered the implementation and management of auditing and logging in a Kubernetes cluster, including an overview of auditing and logging, setting up auditing, configuring audit policies, managing audit logs, and best practices. By understanding how to implement and manage auditing and logging, you can ensure the security and compliance of your Kubernetes environment.
