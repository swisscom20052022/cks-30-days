# Chapter 16: Cluster Setup - Image Security

## Introduction

In this chapter, we will explore the implementation and management of image security in a Kubernetes (K8s) cluster. Image security is crucial for ensuring that the container images used in your cluster are secure and free from vulnerabilities. By the end of this chapter, you will understand how to implement and manage image security to secure your Kubernetes environment.

## Main Concepts

In this chapter, we'll cover the following topics:
- Overview of image security
- Scanning images for vulnerabilities
- Using trusted image registries
- Implementing image policies
- Best practices for image security

### Overview of Image Security

Image security in Kubernetes involves ensuring that the container images used in your cluster are secure and free from vulnerabilities. This includes scanning images for vulnerabilities, using trusted image registries, and implementing image policies to control which images can be used in your cluster.

### Scanning Images for Vulnerabilities

Scanning images for vulnerabilities involves using tools to analyze container images and identify any known vulnerabilities. Here are some popular tools for scanning container images:

1. **Clair**: An open-source project for the static analysis of vulnerabilities in application containers (currently including appc and docker).
2. **Trivy**: A simple and comprehensive vulnerability scanner for containers and other artifacts.
3. **Anchore**: A set of tools that provides deep image inspection, analysis, and certification.

Here is an example of how to scan an image using Trivy:

```sh
trivy image my-image:latest
```

This command will scan the `my-image:latest` image and report any vulnerabilities found.

### Using Trusted Image Registries

Using trusted image registries involves ensuring that the container images used in your cluster come from trusted sources. Here are some best practices for using trusted image registries:

- Use official and verified images from trusted registries, such as Docker Hub, Google Container Registry, and Amazon ECR.
- Implement access controls to restrict who can push and pull images from your registry.
- Regularly scan images in your registry for vulnerabilities.
- Use signed images to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the images.

### Implementing Image Policies

Implementing image policies involves defining rules and policies to control which images can be used in your cluster. Here is an example of how to implement an image policy using Kubernetes' built-in admission controllers:

1. Enable the `ImagePolicyWebhook` admission controller in your Kubernetes API server configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta2
kind: ClusterConfiguration
apiServer:
  extraArgs:
    enable-admission-plugins: ImagePolicyWebhook
```

2. Create an image policy webhook configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
kind: ValidatingWebhookConfiguration
metadata:
  name: image-policy-webhook
webhooks:
  - name: imagepolicy.example.com
    clientConfig:
      service:
        name: image-policy-webhook
        namespace: default
        path: "/validate"
      caBundle: <base64-encoded-ca-cert>
    rules:
      - operations: ["CREATE"]
        apiGroups: [""]
        apiVersions: ["v1"]
        resources: ["pods"]
    admissionReviewVersions: ["v1"]
    sideEffects: None
```

This configuration sets up a webhook that will validate images used in pod creation requests.

### Best Practices for Image Security

- Regularly scan images for vulnerabilities using tools like Clair, Trivy, and Anchore.
- Use trusted image registries and implement access controls to restrict who can push and pull images.
- Use signed images to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the images.
- Implement image policies to control which images can be used in your cluster.
- Regularly update and patch images to address any known vulnerabilities.

## CKS-Specific Tips and Tricks

- Familiarize yourself with the tools and techniques for scanning container images for vulnerabilities.
- Practice setting up and using trusted image registries.
- Understand how to implement image policies using Kubernetes' built-in admission controllers.
- Memorize key commands and concepts that are frequently tested in the exam.

## Summary

In this chapter, we covered the implementation and management of image security in a Kubernetes cluster, including an overview of image security, scanning images for vulnerabilities, using trusted image registries, implementing image policies, and best practices. By understanding how to implement and manage image security, you can ensure that the container images used in your Kubernetes environment are secure and free from vulnerabilities.
