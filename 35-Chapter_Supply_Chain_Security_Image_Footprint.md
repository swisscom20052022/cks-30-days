# Chapter 35: Supply Chain Security - Image Footprint

## Introduction

In this chapter, we will explore the importance of managing the image footprint in a Kubernetes (K8s) cluster to enhance supply chain security. Managing the image footprint involves minimizing the size and complexity of container images to reduce the attack surface and improve security. By the end of this chapter, you will understand how to manage the image footprint to enhance the security of your Kubernetes environment.

## Main Concepts

In this chapter, we'll cover the following topics:
- Overview of image footprint
- Risks associated with large and complex images
- Methods for managing image footprint
- Best practices for managing image footprint
- Monitoring and auditing image footprint

### Overview of Image Footprint

The image footprint refers to the size and complexity of container images used in a Kubernetes cluster. Container images are the building blocks of containers and contain the application code, dependencies, and runtime environment. Managing the image footprint involves minimizing the size and complexity of these images to reduce the attack surface and improve security.

### Risks Associated with Large and Complex Images

Large and complex container images can pose several security risks, including:
- Increased attack surface: Larger images contain more components and dependencies, increasing the potential for vulnerabilities.
- Longer build and deployment times: Large images take longer to build, transfer, and deploy, increasing the risk of delays and potential security issues.
- Difficulty in maintaining and updating: Complex images with many dependencies are harder to maintain and update, increasing the risk of outdated and vulnerable components.

### Methods for Managing Image Footprint

There are several methods for managing the image footprint to ensure that container images are secure and efficient:

1. **Use Minimal Base Images**: Use minimal base images, such as Alpine Linux or Distroless, to reduce the size and complexity of your container images.

2. **Remove Unnecessary Components**: Remove any unnecessary components, dependencies, and tools from your container images to minimize the attack surface.

3. **Multi-Stage Builds**: Use multi-stage builds to separate the build environment from the runtime environment, reducing the size of the final image.

4. **Optimize Dependencies**: Optimize and minimize the dependencies included in your container images to reduce the size and complexity.

5. **Regularly Update Images**: Regularly update your container images to ensure they include the latest security patches and updates.

### Best Practices for Managing Image Footprint

To manage the image footprint securely, follow these best practices:

1. **Use Minimal Base Images**: Use minimal base images to reduce the size and complexity of your container images.

2. **Remove Unnecessary Components**: Remove any unnecessary components, dependencies, and tools from your container images.

3. **Use Multi-Stage Builds**: Use multi-stage builds to separate the build environment from the runtime environment.

4. **Optimize Dependencies**: Optimize and minimize the dependencies included in your container images.

5. **Regularly Update Images**: Regularly update your container images to ensure they include the latest security patches and updates.

6. **Scan Images for Vulnerabilities**: Use image scanning tools to scan your container images for vulnerabilities and address any issues found.

### Monitoring and Auditing Image Footprint

Monitoring and auditing the image footprint is essential for maintaining security. Here are some best practices for monitoring and auditing the image footprint:

- **Image Scanning**: Use image scanning tools to regularly scan your container images for vulnerabilities and address any issues found.

- **Monitoring Tools**: Use monitoring tools to track the size and complexity of your container images and identify any potential issues.

- **Regular Reviews**: Regularly review the components and dependencies included in your container images to ensure they are necessary and up to date.

## CKS-Specific Tips and Tricks

- Familiarize yourself with the process of building and optimizing container images.
- Practice using minimal base images and multi-stage builds in a test environment.
- Understand how to use image scanning tools to scan for vulnerabilities.
- Memorize key commands and concepts that are frequently tested in the exam.
